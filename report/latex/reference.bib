Learning focused on three challenges: the black box learning challenge,
the facial expression recognition challenge, and the multimodal learn-
ing challenge. We describe the datasets created for these challenges and
summarize the results of the competitions. We provide suggestions for or-
ganizers of future challenges and some comments on what kind of knowl-
edge can be gained from machine learning competitions.
